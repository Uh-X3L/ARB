# Dual Trade Opportunity Finder in Rust

This repository contains Rust code for finding and executing dual trade opportunities in the Ethereum network. Dual trades involve swapping one token for another using two different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for potential arbitrage opportunities.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need the following:

- Rust programming language and Cargo package manager installed.
- An Ethereum node or access to an Ethereum API service (e.g., Infura).
- Ethereum smart contract ABIs for the Arb contract and any other relevant assets.
- Configuration files for different networks (e.g., Aurora).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dual-trade-opportunity-finder.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd dual-trade-opportunity-finder
```

3. Install the required dependencies using Cargo.

```bash
cargo build
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and provide your Ethereum node URL and private key as follows:

```env
ETH_NODE_URL=YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL_HERE
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can run the dual trade opportunity finder by executing the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program will start looking for dual trade opportunities based on the provided configuration and profitability criteria. It will periodically log results and attempt to execute profitable trades.

## Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `main.rs`: The main entry point of the program.
- `config.json`: Configuration files for different Ethereum networks (e.g., Aurora, Fantom).
- `YOUR_ARB_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE`: Arb contract ABI in JSON format.
- `YOUR_ASSET_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE`: Asset contract ABI in JSON format.

### Main Functions

- `load_config(network: &str)`: Loads the network-specific configuration file.
- `setup(config: &Value, web3: &Web3<Http>)`: Initializes the setup, including connecting to Ethereum, loading contract instances, and setting up balances.
- `log_results(web3: &Web3<Http>, balances: &[BalanceInfo])`: Logs the difference in balances for each asset and calculates basis points.
- `look_for_dual_trade(...)`: Searches for dual trade opportunities and attempts to execute them based on profitability criteria.
- `use_good_routes(...)`: Selects routes from the configured list sequentially.

## Configuration

To configure the program for your specific use case, you need to provide the following:

- Ethereum node URL: Replace `YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL_HERE` in the `.env` file with your Ethereum node URL.
- Private key: Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE` in the `.env` file with your Ethereum account's private key.
- Arb contract ABI: Replace `YOUR_ARB_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE` with the ABI of your Arb contract.
- Asset contract ABI: Replace `YOUR_ASSET_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE` with the ABI of your asset contract.

You can also customize profitability criteria in the `look_for_dual_trade` function to prioritize routes based on your preferences.

## Performance Measurement

The code includes performance measurement through timestamps. The setup time and periodic log time are recorded to help you evaluate the program's performance. You can monitor these timestamps to assess the efficiency of your code against a target.

Please replace placeholders like `YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_URL_HERE`, `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE`, `YOUR_ARB_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE`, and `YOUR_ASSET_CONTRACT_ABI_HERE` with your actual values and ABIs.
