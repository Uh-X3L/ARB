Asset Availability: Verify which assets and trading pairs are available on the specific Layer 2 solution you choose. Ensure that the assets you intend to trade are supported and have sufficient liquidity.

To retrieve the available assets in StarkNet, you would typically interact with the StarkNet contracts and query their state to obtain a list of supported assets and their details. StarkNet contracts, including those for decentralized exchanges or token swaps, often store information about the available assets and their trading pairs.

Here's a general guide on how you can retrieve available assets in StarkNet:

1. **Identify the Relevant Contract**: Determine which StarkNet contract or decentralized exchange you want to query for available assets. This might be a contract like a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) contract.

2. **Read Contract State**: StarkNet, like Ethereum, allows you to read the state of smart contracts. You'll need to use a StarkNet-compatible development environment or SDK, such as Cairo or the StarkWare SDK, to interact with StarkNet contracts.

3. **Query Asset Information**: Use the contract's methods or functions to query information about available assets. Commonly, you would want to retrieve details like token addresses, symbols, names, and trading pairs.

4. **Parse the Data**: Once you've made the query, you'll receive data from the StarkNet contract. You'll need to parse this data to extract the relevant asset information.

Here's a simplified example in pseudo-code to illustrate the process:

```python
# Initialize StarkNet SDK or Cairo environment
starknet_sdk = StarkNetSDK()

# Specify the contract address for the DEX or relevant contract
contract_address = "0x...your_contract_address_here..."

# Call a contract function to retrieve available assets
assets_data = starknet_sdk.contract_read(contract_address, "getAvailableAssets")

# Parse the data to obtain asset information
available_assets = parse_assets_data(assets_data)

# Print the available assets
for asset in available_assets:
    print(f"Asset Address: {asset['address']}")
    print(f"Symbol: {asset['symbol']}")
    print(f"Name: {asset['name']}")
    # Add more details as needed
```

In this example:

- You initialize the StarkNet SDK or environment.

- You specify the contract address of the relevant StarkNet contract.

- You call a contract function (e.g., `getAvailableAssets`) to retrieve data about available assets.

- You parse the received data to extract the asset information.

- Finally, you can print the available assets with their details.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified illustration, and the actual implementation would depend on the specific StarkNet contract you are interacting with and the programming language or SDK you are using. You'll need to refer to the contract's documentation and use the appropriate SDK or tooling for StarkNet development.


from starknet import StarkNet

# Initialize a StarkNet instance connected to a StarkNet node
starknet = StarkNet(StarkNet.HTTPProvider('YOUR_STARKNET_NODE_URL'))

# Specify the contract address (replace with the actual contract address)
contract_address = '0x...your_contract_address_here...'

# Load the contract ABI (replace with the actual ABI)
contract_abi = [
   # Define the contract ABI here
]

# Create a contract instance
contract = starknet.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

# Example function to retrieve available assets
def get_available_assets():
   try:
       # Call a contract function (replace with the actual function and parameters)
       result = contract.functions.getAvailableAssets().call()

       # Process the result (assuming it returns a list of assets)
       available_assets = result # Modify this based on your contract's structure

       return available_assets

   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
       return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
   available_assets = get_available_assets()

   if available_assets is not None:
       print("Available Assets:")
       for asset in available_assets:
           print(f"Asset Address: {asset['address']}")
           print(f"Symbol: {asset['symbol']}")
           print(f"Name: {asset['name']}")
           print()
